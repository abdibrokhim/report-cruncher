Summary of Significant Accounting Policies\nNature of Operations\nGoogle was incorporated in California in [DATE] and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in\nAugust 2003. In [YEAR], we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc.\n(\"Alphabet\") became the successor issuer to Google.\nWe generate revenues by delivering relevant, costeffective online advertising ; cloudbased solutions that\nprovide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and\nservices, such as apps and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for\nsubscriptionbased products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.\nBasis of Consolidation\nThe consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated\nunder the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.\nUnaudited Interim Financial Information\nThese unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally\naccepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal\nrecurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation. Interim results are not necessarily indicative of\nthe results to be expected for the full year ending [DATE], [YEAR] . We have made estimates and assumptions\nthat affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual\nresults could differ materially from these estimates.\nThese consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form [NUM-TXT] should be read in\nconjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form\n[NUM-TXT] for the fiscal year ended [DATE], [YEAR] filed with the SEC.\nNote 2.

Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer\ncontracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues. The amount and timing of revenue\nrecognition for these commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver\nin accordance with relevant contract terms, which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect\nto recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as\namounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or\nless and cancellable contracts.\nWe record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance,\nincluding amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other.\nTotal deferred revenue as of [DATE], [YEAR] was $3.8 billion , of which $1.4 billion was recognized as revenues\nduring the three months ended [DATE], [YEAR] .\nNote 3. Financial Instruments\nDebt Securiti es\nWe classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as availableforsale, within Level 2 in the\nfair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and\nmodels utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.\nFor certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value\nare recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the\nunrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net losses related to debt securities still\nheld where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million and $236 million as of [DATE], [YEAR] and\n[DATE], [YEAR] , respectively. As of [DATE], [YEAR] and [DATE], [YEAR] , the fair value of these debt securities\nwas $4.7 billion and $5.6 billion , respectively .\nThe following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant\ninvestment categories (in millions):\nAs of [DATE], [YEAR]\nAdjusted\nCostGross\nUnrealized\nGainsGross\nUnrealized\nLossesFair\nValueCash and\nCash\nEquivalentsMarketable\nSecurities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1)$ 5,133 $ 0 $ 0 $ 5,133 $ 5,133 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 53,288 258 (238) 53,308 5 53,303\nCorporate debt securities 35,605 194 (223) 35,576 12 35,564\nMortgagebacked and assetbacked\nsecurities 18,829 96 (112) 18,813 0 18,813\nTotal $ 112,855 $ 548 $ (573) $ 112,830 $ 5,150 $ 107,680 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n11 As of [DATE], [YEAR]\nAdjusted\nCostGross\nUnrealized\nGainsGross\nUnrealized\nLossesFair\nValueCash and\nCash\nEquivalentsMarketable\nSecurities\nLevel 2:\nTime deposits(1)$ 4,690 $ 0 $ 0 $ 4,690 $ 4,690 $ 0\nGovernment bonds 50,485 58 (1,365) 49,178 0 49,178\nCorporate debt securities 36,621 30 (1,043) 35,608 10 35,598\nMortgagebacked and assetbacked\nsecurities 18,852 6 (594) 18,264 0 18,264\nTotal $ 110,648 $ 94 $ (3,002) $ 107,740 $ 4,700 $ 103,040\n(1)The majority of our time deposits are domestic deposits.\nWe determine realized gains or losses on the sale or extinguishment of debt securities on a specific\nidentification method.

The carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable\ntransactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement\nalternative). Nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable\ntransactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based\non valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date\nand other unobservable inputs including volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of\nnonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.\nGains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities\nGains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for marketable and nonmarketable equity\nsecurities are summarized below (in millions):\nThree Months Ended\n[DATE],\n[YEAR] [YEAR]\nNet gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 201 $ (74)\nNet unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period 4,636 (996)\nTotal gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 4,837 $ (1,070)\nIn the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the\nsale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if\nlater.\nCumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following\ntable (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity\nsecurity. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are\nimportant supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains on the securities sold during the period.\nCumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the\nequity security sold during the period.\nEquity Securities Sold\nThree Months Ended\n[DATE],\n[YEAR] [YEAR]\nTotal sale price $ 725 $ 364\nTotal initial cost 357 260\nCumulative net gains $ 368 $ 104 Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]arrying value of marketable and nonmarketable equity securities\nThe carrying value is measured as the total initial cost plus the cumulative net gain (loss).

Our share of gains and losses , including\nimpairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of\nIncome. See Note 6 for further details on other income (expense), net.\nDerivative Financial Instruments\nWe enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary\nrisk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the\nrisk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign\ncurrency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to\nother risks and enhance investment returns.\nWe recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair\nvalue and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts\n(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the\npurchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross\nfair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other\nincome (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.\nWe enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of\ntransactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for\ncollateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from\ncontractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral\nsecurity arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and noncash\ncollateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other\ncurrent assets.\nCash Flow Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge\ncertain f orecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have\nmaturities of 24 months or less.\nCash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and\nsubsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in\nforward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded\ncomponent is amortized on a straightline basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues.\nThe difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is\nrecorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI\nare reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of dedesignation.\nAs of [DATE], [YEAR] , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect\nwas $356 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]air Value Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our\ninvestments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the\nassessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains\nand losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge\neffectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.\nNet Investment Hedges\nWe designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks\nrelated to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of\nhedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude\nchanges in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded\ncomponent in other income (expense), net.\nOther Derivatives\nOther derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts\nthat we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies\nother than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs,\nare recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets\nand liabilities.\nWe also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates,\ncommodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into\nderivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from\nthese derivatives are reflected within the \"other\" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting\nrecognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity\nsecurities, net component of other income (expense), net.

Contingencies\nIndemnifications\nIn the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate\nactivities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud\nofferings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties\nharmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property\ninfringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which\nan indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification\nagreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.\nIt is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification\nagreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have\na limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not\nhad a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent\nthat valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a\nmaterial adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period.\nAs of [DATE], [YEAR] , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably\npossible.\nLegal Matters\nAntitrust Investigations\nOn [DATE], [YEAR], the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various\nantitrustrelated complaints against us.\nOn [DATE], [YEAR], the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display\nand ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a\n\u20ac2.4 billion ($2.7 billion as of [DATE], [YEAR]) fine. On [DATE], [YEAR], we appealed the EC decision to the\nGeneral Court, and on [DATE], [YEAR], we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into\ncompliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion for the fine in the second quarter of [YEAR].\nOn [DATE], [YEAR], the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the\nEuropean Court of Justice on [DATE], [YEAR].\nOn [DATE], [YEAR], the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google\u2019s Androidrelated distribution\nagreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a \u20ac4.3 billion ($5.1 billion as of [DATE],\n[YEAR]) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On [DATE], [YEAR], we appealed the EC decision,\nwhich remains pending. On [DATE], [YEAR], we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution\npractices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion for the fine in the second quarter of [YEAR].\nOn [DATE], [YEAR], the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that\nGoogle had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine\nof \u20ac1.5 billion ($1.7 billion as of [DATE], [YEAR]) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners'\nagreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On [DATE], [YEAR], we appealed the EC decision, which\nremains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion for the fine in the first quarter of [YEAR].\nWhile each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities\non our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]rom time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by\nregulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August [YEAR], we began\nreceiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and\ndocuments relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number\nof state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on [DATE], [YEAR] alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws\nrelating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on [DATE], [YEAR], a number of state Attorneys General\nfiled an antitrust complaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that\nGoogle violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On\n[DATE], [YEAR], the EC opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices. On\n[DATE], [YEAR], a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for\nthe Northern District of California, alleging that Google\u2019s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S.\nantitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We believe these complaints are without merit and\nwill defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ, state Attorneys General, and EC continue their investigations into certain\naspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other\nregulators around the world.\nPatent and Intellectual Property Claims\nWe have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that\ncertain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in\nthese lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or\norders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have\nto change our business practices and develop noninfringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss\nof revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has\nincreasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC\naction can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important\nmarket, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing\nmany important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.\nFurthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against\ncertain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such\nclaims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In\naddition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a\nresult of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.\nOther\nWe are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings,\nand consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related\ncompliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services\noffered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters.\nFor example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such\nclaims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in\nsubstantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our\nproducts and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or\nother adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating\nresults.\nWe have ongoing legal matters in Russia. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material\nadverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.\nCertain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a\nliability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably\nestimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we\ndisclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount\nof liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and\nmake adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being\nand the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.\nWith respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range\nof reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our\nbusiness, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such\nmatters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]e expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.\nNonIncome Taxes\nWe are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to nonincome tax matters.\nThe subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied\nto the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We\naccrue nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax\nauthorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and\nthe loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity\nand uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially\ndifferent from our expectations.\nFor information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13 .\nNote 10. Stockholders' Equity\nShare Repurchases\nIn April [YEAR], the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion of its\nClass C stock.

We report Google in two segments,\nGoogle Services and Google Cloud; we also report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other\nBets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on\nour segments, see Note 14 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly\nReport on Form [NUM-TXT].\nSeasonality and other\nOur advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and\nunderlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our nonadvertising revenues ,\nincluding those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play, hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by\nfluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches,\nand other market dynamics, as well as seasonality.\nRevenues and Monetization Metrics\nGoogle Services\nGoogle Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (\u201cGoogle advertising\u201d) as well as\nrevenues from other sources (\u201cGoogle other revenues\u201d).\nGoogle Advertising\nGoogle advertising revenues are comprised of the following:\nGoogle Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including\nrevenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search\nin browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and\nGoogle Play;\nYouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and\nGoogle Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob,\nAdSense, and Google Ad Manager.\nWe use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our\nadvertising revenues: paid clicks and costperclick pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while\nimpressions and costperimpressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners\u2019 properties.\nPaid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on Google\nsearch properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google\nPlay. Costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the\naverage amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.\nImpressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in\nAdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased\nrevenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for\neach impression displayed to users.\nAs our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring,\ngathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues\ngenerated by the corresponding click and impression activity.\nOur advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on Google Search &\nother properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on Google Network properties and the\ncorrelation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:\nadvertiser competition for keywords;Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]hanges in advertising quality, formats, delivery or policy;\nchanges in device mix;\nchanges in foreign currency exchange rates;\nfees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;\ngeneral econo mic conditions and various external dynamics, including t he effect of COVI[TXT-NUM], geopolitical\nevents, regulations and other measures;\nseasonality; and\ntraffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising\nverticals and channels.\nGoogle Other\nGoogle other revenues are comprised of the following:\nGoogle Play, which includes sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play\nstore;\nDevices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest\nhome products, and Pixel phones;\nYouTube nonadvertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and\nother products and services.\nGoogle Cloud\nGoogle Cloud revenues are comprised of the following:\nGoogle Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;\nGoogle Workspace, which includes fees for cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail,\nDocs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and\nother enterprise services.\nOther Bets\nRevenues from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.\nFor further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial\nStatements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form [NUM-TXT] for the fiscal year ended [DATE],\n[YEAR] .\nCosts and Expenses\nOur cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses\ninclude costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these\nexpenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our\noperating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.\nCost of Revenues\nCost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.\nTAC includes:\n\u25e6Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and\nservices. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment\nmanufacturers, and software developers.\n\u25e6Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.\nOther cost of revenues includes:\n\u25e6Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video\nand other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content\nproviders based on revenues generated or a flat fee).Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n31\u25e6Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses,\ndepreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content\nreview as well as customer and product support costs).\n\u25e6Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.\nThe cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties\nare significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on\nGoogle Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network\nproperties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.\nOperating Expenses\nOperating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as\neither R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.\nThe main components of our R&D expenses are:\ncompensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our\nexisting and new products and services;\ndepreciation; and\nprofessional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.\nThe main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:\ncompensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain\ncustomer service functions; and\nspending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.\nThe main components of our general and administrative expenses are:\ncompensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and\nother administrative support functions;\nexpenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and\nprofessional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.\nOther Income (Expense), Net\nOther income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency\nexchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and nonmarketable securities,\nperformance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments.\nFor additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in\nthe value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item\n8 and Item [NUM-TXT], \u201cQuantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk\u201d in our An nual Report on Form [NUM-TXT] for\nthe fiscal year ended [DATE], [YEAR] as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements\nincluded in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form [NUM-TXT].\nProvision for Income Taxes\nProvision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes\nincurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate.

We use nonGAAP constant currency revenues and nonGAAP percentage change in constant\ncurrency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod\ncomparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps\nimprove the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that\nare not indicative of our core operating results.\nConstant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant\nperiod over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign\nexchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue\npercentage change on a yearonyear basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current\nperiod revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects\nrealized in the current period.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]onstant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period\nrevenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are\ntranslated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of\nboth periods.\nThese results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with\nGAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled\nmeasures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.\nThe following table presents the foreign exchange effect on international revenues and total revenues (in\nmillions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\n[DATE],\n[YEAR] [YEAR]% Change from\nPrior Year\nEMEA revenues $ 17,031 $ 20,317 19 %\nEMEA constant currency revenues 21,628 27 %\nAPAC revenues 10,455 11,841 13 %\nAPAC constant currency revenues 12,440 19 %\nOther Americas revenues 2,905 3,842 32 %\nOther Americas constant currency revenues 3,923 35 %\nUnited States revenues 25,032 31,733 27 %\nHedging gains (losses) (109) 278\nTotal revenues $ 55,314 $ 68,011 23 %\nRevenues, excluding hedging effect $ 55,423 $ 67,733\nExchange rate effect 1,991\nTotal constant currency revenues $ 69,724 26 %\nEMEA revenue growth from the three months ended [DATE], [YEAR] to the three months ended [DATE],\n[YEAR] was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar\nstrengthening relative to the Euro.\nAPAC revenue growth from the three months ended [DATE], [YEAR] to the three months ended [DATE],\n[YEAR] was unfavorably affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates, primarily due to the U.S. dollar\nstrengthening relative to the Japanese yen.\nOther Americas revenue growth from the three months ended [DATE], [YEAR] to the three months ended\n[DATE], [YEAR] was not materially affected by changes in foreign currency exchange rates .\nCosts and Expenses\nCost of Revenues\nThe following table presents cost of revenues, including TAC (in millions, except percentages):\nThree Months Ended\n[DATE],\n[YEAR] [YEAR]\nTAC $ 9,712 $ 11,990\nOther cost of revenues 14,391 17,609\nTotal cost of revenues $ 24,103 $ 29,599\nTotal cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues 43.6 % 43.5 %Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]ost of revenues increased $5.5 billion from the three months ended [DATE], [YEAR] to the three months\nended [DATE], [YEAR] .

QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK\nFor quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item [NUM-TXT], Quantitative and\nQualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form [NUM-TXT] for the year ended [DATE],\n[YEAR] .\nITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES\nEvaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures\nOur management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the\neffectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13[TXT-NUM] under the Exchange Act, as of the\nend of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form [NUM-TXT].\nBased on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of [DATE],\n[YEAR] , our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to\nprovide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the\nExchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC\u2019s\nrules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our\nchief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required\ndisclosure.\nChanges in Internal Control over Financial Reporting\nWe rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating\nresults. In [YEAR], we began a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system,\nwhich will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain\nour financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely\ninformation to our management team. The implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few\nyears. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter\nended [DATE], [YEAR] that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control\nover financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change\nour processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting.\nAs such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over\nfinancial reporting.\nAs a result of COVI[TXT-NUM], our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment\nfor the quarter ended [DATE], [YEAR] . While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven\neffects of the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting\ncontinue to be effective. We have continued to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide\nreasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.\nLimitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures\nIn designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls\nand procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving\nthe desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that\nthere are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of\npossible controls and procedures relative to their costs.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.\n[NUM-TXT]ART II.
