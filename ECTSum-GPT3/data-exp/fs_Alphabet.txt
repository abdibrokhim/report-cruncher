2Note About ForwardLooking Statements
This Quarterly Report on Form 10Q contains forwardlooking statements within the meaning of the Private

our business, operations, and financial results; 
the growth of our business and revenues and our expectations about the factors that influence our success 
and trends in our business;
fluctuations in our revenue growth rate and operating margin and various factors contributing to such 
fluctuations;
our expectation that the continuing shift from an offline to online world will continue to benefit our business;
our expectation that the portion of our revenues that we derive from nonadvertising revenues will continue 
to increase and may affect our margins;
our expectation that our traffic acquisition costs (TAC) and the associated TAC rate will fluctuate, which 
could affect our overall margins;
our expectation that our monetization trends will fluctuate, which could affect our revenues and margins;
fluctuations in our revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick and the change in 
impressions and costperimpression, and various factors contributing to such fluctuations;
our expectation that we will continue to periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for 
monitoring, gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and impressions;
our expectation that our results will be affected by our performance in international markets as users in 
developing economies increasingly come online;

fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates;

obligations, including our estimate of the remaining amount of commitments and when we expect to

our expectation that our cost of revenues, research and development (R&D) expenses, sales and marketing 
expenses, and general and administrative expenses may increase in amount and/or may increase as a 
percentage of revenues and may be affected by a number of factors;
estimates of our future compensation expenses;
our expectation that our other income (expense), net (OI&E), will fluctuate in the future, as it is largely 
driven by market dynamics;
fluctuations in our effective tax rate;
seasonal fluctuations in internet usage and advertiser expenditures, underlying business trends such as 
traditional retail seasonality, which are likely to cause fluctuations in our quarterly results;
the sufficiency of our sources of funding;

NOTES TO CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
(Unaudited)
Note 1.    Summary of Significant Accounting Policies  
Nature of Operations
Google was incorporated in California in September 1998 and reincorporated in the State of Delaware in 
August 2003. In 2015, we implemented a holding company reorganization, and as a result, Alphabet Inc. 
("Alphabet") became the successor issuer to Google.
We generate revenues by delivering relevant, costeffective online advertising ; cloudbased solutions that 
provide customers with infrastructure and platform services and collaboration tools; sales of other products and 
services, such as apps and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for 
subscriptionbased products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV. 
Basis of Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements of Alphabet include the accounts of Alphabet and entities consolidated 
under the variable interest and voting models. All intercompany balances and transactions have been eliminated.  
Unaudited Interim Financial Information
These unaudited interim consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the United States (GAAP), and in our opinion, include all adjustments of a normal 
recurring nature necessary for fair financial statement presentation.  Interim results are not necessarily indicative of 
the results to be expected for the full year ending December 31, 2022 . We have made estimates and assumptions 
that affect the amounts reported and disclosed in the financial statements and the accompanying notes. Actual 
results could differ materially from these estimates.
These consolidated financial statements and other information presented in this Form 10Q should be read in 
conjunction with the consolidated financial statements and the related notes included in our Annual Report on Form 
10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021  filed with the SEC.

Revenue Backlog and Deferred Revenues
As of March 31, 2022 , we had $50.5 billion  of remaining performance obligations (“revenue backlog”), primarily 
related to Google Cloud, and expect to recogniz e approximately half of this amount as revenues over the next 24 
months with the remaining to be recognized thereafter. Our revenue backlog represents commitments in customer 
contracts for future services that have not yet been recognized as revenues.  The amount and timing of revenue 
recognition for these  commitments is largely driven by when our customers utilize services and our ability to deliver 
in accordance with relevant contract terms,  which could affect our estimate of revenue backlog and when we expect 
to recognize such as revenues. Revenue backlog includes related deferred revenue currently recorded as well as 
amounts that will be invoiced in future periods and excludes contracts with an original expected term of one year or 
less and cancellable contracts.
We record deferred revenues when cash payments are received or due in advance of our performance, 
including amounts which are refundable. Deferred revenues primarily relate to Google Cloud and Google other. 
Total deferred revenue as of December 31, 2021  was $3.8 billion , of which $1.4 billion  was recognized as revenues 
during the three months ended March 31, 2022 .
Note 3.    Financial Instruments
Debt  Securiti es
We classify our marketable debt securities, which are accounted for as availableforsale, within Level 2 in the 
fair value hierarchy because we use quoted market prices to the extent available or alternative pricing sources and 
models utilizing market observable inputs to determine fair value.
For certain marketable debt securities, we have elected the fair value option for which changes in fair value 
are recorded in other income (expense), net. The fair value option was elected for these securities to align with the 
unrealized gains and losses from related derivative contracts. Unrealized net  losses  related to debt securities still 
held where we have elected the fair value option were $35 million  and $236 million  as of December 31, 2021  and 
March 31, 2022 , respectively. As of December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 , the fair value of these debt securities 
was $4.7 billion  and $5.6 billion , respectively . 
The following tables summarize debt securities, for which we did not elect the fair value option, by significant 
investment categories (in millions):

12Equity Investments
The following discusses our marketable equity securities, nonmarketable equity securities, gains and losses 
on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities, as well as our equity securities accounted for under the equity 
method.
Our marketable equity securities are publicly traded stocks or funds measured at fair value and classified 
within Level 1 and 2 in the fair value hierarchy because we use quoted prices for identical assets in active markets 
or inputs that are based upon quoted prices for similar instruments in active markets.
Our nonmarketable equity securities are investments in privately held companies without readily determinable 
market values. The carrying value of our nonmarketable equity securities is adjusted to fair value upon observable 
transactions for identical or similar investments of the same issuer or impairment (referred to as the measurement 
alternative). Nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured during the period based on observable 
transactions are classified within Level 2 or Level 3 in the fair value hierarchy because we estimate the value based 
on valuation methods which may include a combination of the observable transaction price at the transaction date 
and other unobservable inputs including  volatility, rights, and obligations of the securities we hold. The fair value of 
nonmarketable equity securities that have been remeasured due to impairment are classified within Level 3.
Gains and losses on marketable and nonmarketable equity securities
Gains and losses reflected in other income (expense), net, for  marketable and nonmarketable equity 
securities are summarized below (in millions):
Three Months Ended
March 31,
2021 2022
Net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period $ 201 $ (74) 
Net unrealized gain (loss) on equity securities held as of the end of the period  4,636  (996) 
Total gain (loss) recognized in other income (expense), net $ 4,837 $ (1,070) 
In the table above, net gain (loss) on equity securities sold during the period reflects the difference between the 
sale proceeds and the carrying value of the equity securities at the beginning of the period or the purchase date, if 
later. 
Cumulative net gains (losses) on equity securities sold during the period, which is summarized in the following 
table (in millions), represents the total net gains (losses) recognized after the initial purchase date of the equity 
security. While these net gains may have been reflected in periods prior to the period of sale, we believe they are 
important supplemental information as they reflect the economic net gains on the securities sold during the period. 
Cumulative net gains are calculated as the difference between the sale price and the initial purchase price for the 
equity security sold during the period.

securities held as of the end of the period, $3.1 billion  were measured at fair value resulting in a net unrealized gain 
of $0.5 billion .
Equity securities accounted for under the Equity Method
As of December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 , equity securities accounted for under the equity method had a 
carrying value of approximately $ 1.5 billion  and $1.4 billion , respectively. Our share of gains and losses , including 
impairments, are included as a component of other income (expense), net, in the Consolidated Statements of 
Income.  See Note 6  for further details on other income (expense), net.
Derivative Financial Instruments
We enter into derivative instruments to manage risks relating to our ongoing business operations. The primary 
risk managed with derivative instruments is foreign exchange risk. We use foreign currency contracts to reduce the 
risk that our cash flows, earnings, and investment in foreign subsidiaries will be adversely affected by foreign 
currency exchange rate fluctuations. We also enter into derivative instruments to partially offset our exposure to 
other risks and enhance investment returns.
We recognize derivative instruments as either assets or liabilities in the Consolidated Balance Sheets at fair 
value and classify the derivatives primarily within Level 2 in the fair value hierarchy. We present our collar contracts 
(an option strategy comprised of a combination of purchased and written options) at net fair values where both the 
purchased and written options are with the same counterparty. For other derivative contracts, we present at gross 
fair values. We primarily record changes in the fair value in the Consolidated Statements of Income as either other 
income (expense), net, or revenues, or in the Consolidated Balance Sheets in AOCI, as discussed below.
We enter into master netting arrangements, which reduce credit risk by permitting net settlement of 
transactions with the same counterparty. Further, we enter into collateral security arrangements that provide for 
collateral to be received or pledged when the net fair value of certain financial instruments fluctuates from 
contractually established thresholds. Cash collateral received related to derivative instruments under our collateral 
security arrangements are included in other current assets with a corresponding liability. Cash and noncash 
collateral pledged related to derivative instruments under our collateral security arrangements are included in other 
current assets.
Cash Flow Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward and option contracts (including collars) as cash flow hedges to hedge 
certain f orecasted revenue transactions denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. These contracts have 
maturities of 24 months  or less.
Cash flow hedge amounts included in the assessment of hedge effectiveness are deferred in AOCI and 
subsequently reclassified to revenue when the hedged item is recognized in earnings. We exclude the change in 
forward points and time value from our assessment of hedge effectiveness. The initial value of the excluded 
component is amortized on a straightline basis over the life of the hedging instrument and recognized in revenues. 
The difference between fair value changes of the excluded component and the amount amortized to revenues is 
recorded in AOCI. If the hedged transactions become probable of not occurring, the corresponding amounts in AOCI 
are reclassified to other income (expense), net in the period of dedesignation.
As of March 31, 2022 , the net accumulated gain on our foreign currency cash flow hedges before tax effect 
was $356 million , which is expected to be reclassified from AOCI into earnings within the next 12 months.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
15Fair Value Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as fair value hedges to hedge foreign currency risks for our 
investments denominated in currencies other than the U.S. dollar. Fair value hedge amounts included in the 
assessment of hedge effectiveness are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the offsetting gains 
and losses of the related hedged items. We exclude changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge 
effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded component in other income (expense), net.
Net Investment Hedges
We designate foreign currency forward contracts as net investment hedges to hedge the foreign currency risks 
related to our investment in foreign subsidiaries. Net investment hedge amounts included in the assessment of 
hedge effectiveness are recognized in AOCI along with the foreign currency translation adjustment. We exclude 
changes in forward points from the assessment of hedge effectiveness and recognize changes in the excluded 
component in other income (expense), net.
Other Derivatives
Other derivatives not designated as hedging instruments consist primarily of foreign currency forward contracts 
that we use to hedge intercompany transactions and other monetary assets or liabilities denominated in currencies 
other than the functional currency of a subsidiary. Gains and losses on these contracts, as well as the related costs, 
are recognized in other income (expense), net, along with the foreign currency gains and losses on monetary assets 
and liabilities. 
We also use derivatives not designated as hedging instruments to manage risks relating to interest rates, 
commodity prices, credit exposures and to enhance investment returns. Additionally, from time to time, we enter into 
derivatives to hedge the market price risk on certain of our marketable equity securities. Gains (losses) arising from 
these derivatives are reflected within the "other" component of other income (expense), net and the offsetting 
recognized gains (losses) on the marketable equity securities are reflected within the gain (loss) on equity 
securities, net component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6  for further details on other income (expense),

Note 4.    Variable Interest Entities (VIE)  
Consolidated VIEs
We consolidate VIEs in which we hold a variable interest and are the primary beneficiary. The results of 
operations and financial position of these VIEs are included in our consolidated financial statements.
For certain consolidated VIEs, their assets are not available to us and their creditors do not have recourse to 
us. As of December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 , assets that can only be used to settle obligations of these VIEs 
were $6.0 billion  and $5.5 billion , respectively, and the liabilities for which creditors only have recourse to the VIEs 
were  $2.5 billion  and $2.4 billion , respectively . 
As of December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 , total noncontrolling interests (NCI), including redeemable 
noncontrolling interests (RNCI), in our consolidated subsidiaries was $4.3 billion  for both periods.  NCI and RNCI are Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
19included within additional paidin capital. Net loss attributable to noncontrolling intere sts was not material for an y 
period presented and is included within the "other" component of other income (expense), net. See Note 6  for 
further details on other income (expense), net.
Unconsolidated VIEs
We have investments in VIEs in which we are not the primary beneficiary. These VIEs include private 
companies that are primarily early stage companies and certain renewable energy entities in which activities involve 
power generation using renewable sources. 
We have determined that the governance structures of these entities do not allow us to direct the activities that 
would significantly affect their economic performance. Therefore, we are not the primary beneficiary, and the results 
of operations and financial position of these VIEs are not included in our consolidated financial statements. We 
account for these investments as nonmarketable equity securities or equity method investments.
 The maximum exposure of these unconsolidated VIEs is generally based on the current carrying value of the  
investments and any future funding commitments.  We have determined that the single source of our exposure to 
these VIEs is our capital investments in them. The carrying value and maximum exposure of these unconsolidated 
VIEs were  $2.7 billion  and  $2.9 billion , respectively, as of December 31, 2021  and $2.8 billion  and $2.9 billion , 
respectively, as of March 31, 2022 .
Note 5.    Debt
ShortTerm Debt
We have a debt financing program of up to  $10.0 billion  through the issuance of commercial paper. Net 
proceeds from this program are used for general corporate purposes. We had  no commercial paper outstanding  as 
of December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 .

The notes in the table above are fixedrate senior unsecured obligations and generally rank equally with each 
other. We may redeem the notes at any time in whole or in part at specified redemption prices. The effective interest 
rates are based on proceeds received with interest payable semiannually.
The total estimated fair value of the outstanding notes was approximately $12.4 billion  and $11.4 billion  as of 
December 31, 2021  and March 31, 2022 , respectively. The fair value was determined based on observable market 
prices of identical instruments in less active markets and is categorized accordingly as Level 2 in the fair value 
hierarchy.

Note 9.    Contingencies
Indemnifications
In the normal course of business, including to facilitate transactions in our services and products and corporate 
activities, we indemnify certain parties, including advertisers, Google Network partners, customers of Google Cloud 
offerings, lessors, and service providers with respect to certain matters. We have agreed to hold certain parties 
harmless against losses arising from a breach of representations or covenants, or out of intellectual property 
infringement or other claims made against certain parties. Several of these agreements limit the time within which 
an indemnification claim can be made and the amount of the claim. In addition, we have entered into indemnification 
agreements with our officers and directors, and our bylaws contain similar indemnification obligations to our agents.
It is not possible to make a reasonable estimate of the maximum potential amount under these indemnification 
agreements due to the unique facts and circumstances involved in each particular agreement. Additionally, we have 
a limited history of prior indemnification claims and the payments we have made under such agreements have not 
had a material adverse effect on our results of operations, cash flows, or financial position. However, to the extent 
that valid indemnification claims arise in the future, future payments by us could be significant and could have a 
material adverse effect on our results of operations or cash flows in a particular period. 
As of March 31, 2022 , we did not have any material indemnification claims that were probable or reasonably 
possible.
Legal Matters
Antitrust Investigations
On November 30, 2010, the EC's Directorate General for Competition opened an investigation into various 
antitrustrelated complaints against us. 
On June 27, 2017, the EC announced its decision that certain actions taken by Google regarding its display 
and ranking of shopping search results and ads infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a 
€2.4 billion  ($2.7 billion  as of June 27, 2017) fine. On September 11, 2017, we appealed the EC decision to the 
General Court, and on September 27, 2017, we implemented product changes to bring shopping ads into 
compliance with the EC's decision. We recognized a charge of $2.7 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2017. 
On November 10, 2021, the General Court rejected our appeal, and we subsequently filed an appeal with the 
European Court of Justice on January 20, 2022.
On July 18, 2018, the EC announced its decision that certain provisions in Google’s Androidrelated distribution 
agreements infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a €4.3 billion  ($5.1 billion  as of June 30, 
2018) fine and directed the termination of the conduct at issue. On October 9, 2018, we appealed the EC decision, 
which remains pending. On October 29, 2018, we implemented changes to certain of our Android distribution 
practices. We recognized a charge of $5.1 billion  for the fine in the second quarter of 2018.
On March 20, 2019, the EC announced its decision that certain contractual provisions in agreements that 
Google had with AdSense for Search partners infringed European competition law. The EC decision imposed a fine 
of €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of March 20, 2019) and directed actions related to AdSense for Search partners' 
agreements, which we implemented prior to the decision. On June 4, 2019, we appealed the EC decision, which 
remains pending. We recognized a charge of $1.7 billion  for the fine in the first quarter of 2019.
While each EC decision is under appeal, we included the fines in accrued expenses and other current liabilities 
on our Consolidated Balance Sheets as we provided bank guarantees (in lieu of a cash payment) for the fines.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
24From time to time we are subject to formal and informal inquiries and investigations on competition matters by 
regulatory authorities in the United States (U.S.), Europe, and other jurisdictions. In August 2019, we began 
receiving civil investigative demands from the U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) requesting information and 
documents relating to our prior antitrust investigations and certain aspects of our business. The DOJ and a number 
of state Attorneys General filed a lawsuit on October 20, 2020 alleging that Google violated U.S. antitrust laws 
relating to Search and Search advertising. Separately, on December 16, 2020, a number of state Attorneys General 
filed an antitrust complaint against Google in the U.S. District Court for the Eastern District of Texas, alleging that 
Google violated U.S. antitrust laws as well as state deceptive trade laws relating to its advertising technology. On 
June 22, 2021, the EC opened a formal investigation into Google's advertising technology business practices. On 
July 7, 2021, a number of state Attorneys General filed an antitrust complaint against us in the U.S. District Court for 
the Northern District of California, alleging that Google’s operation of Android and Google Play violated U.S. 
antitrust laws and state antitrust and consumer protection laws. We believe these complaints are without merit and 
will defend ourselves vigorously. The DOJ, state Attorneys General, and EC continue their investigations into certain 
aspects of our business. We continue to cooperate with federal and state regulators in the U.S., the EC, and other 
regulators around the world.
Patent and Intellectual Property Claims
We have had patent, copyright, trade secret, and trademark infringement lawsuits filed against us claiming that 
certain of our products, services, and technologies infringe others' intellectual property rights. Adverse results in 
these lawsuits may include awards of substantial monetary damages, costly royalty or licensing agreements, or 
orders preventing us from offering certain features, functionalities, products, or services. As a result, we may have 
to change our business practices and develop noninfringing products or technologies, which could result in a loss 
of revenues for us and otherwise harm our business. In addition, the U.S. International Trade Commission (ITC) has 
increasingly become an important forum to litigate intellectual property disputes because an ultimate loss in an ITC 
action can result in a prohibition on importing infringing products into the U.S. Because the U.S. is an important 
market, a prohibition on importation could have an adverse effect on us, including preventing us from importing 
many important products into the U.S. or necessitating workarounds that may limit certain features of our products.
Furthermore, many of our agreements with our customers and partners require us to indemnify them against 
certain intellectual property infringement claims, which would increase our costs as a result of defending such 
claims, and may require that we pay significant damages if there were an adverse ruling in any such claims. In 
addition, our customers and partners may discontinue the use of our products, services, and technologies, as a 
result of injunctions or otherwise, which could result in loss of revenues and adversely affect our business.
Other
We are also regularly subject to claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, 
and consent decrees involving competition, intellectual property, privacy and cybersecurity, tax and related 
compliance, labor and employment, commercial disputes, content generated by our users, goods and services 
offered by advertisers or publishers using our platforms, personal injury, consumer protection, and other matters. 
For example, we currently have a number of privacy investigations and suits ongoing in multiple jurisdictions. Such 
claims, suits, regulatory and government investigations, other proceedings, and consent decrees could result in 
substantial fines and penalties, injunctive relief, ongoing auditing and monitoring obligations, changes to our 
products and services, alterations to our business models and operations, and collateral related civil litigation or 
other adverse consequences, all of which could harm our business, reputation, financial condition, and operating 
results.
We have ongoing legal matters in Russia. We do not believe these ongoing legal matters will have a material 
adverse effect on our business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows.
Certain outstanding matters include speculative, substantial or indeterminate monetary amounts. We record a 
liability when we believe that it is probable that a loss has been incurred, and the amount can be reasonably 
estimated. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we 
disclose the reasonably possible loss. We evaluate developments in our legal matters that could affect the amount 
of liability that has been previously accrued, and the matters and related reasonably possible losses disclosed, and 
make adjustments as appropriate. Significant judgment is required to determine both the likelihood of there being 
and the estimated amount of a loss related to such matters.
With respect to our outstanding matters, based on our current knowledge, we believe that the amount or range 
of reasonably possible loss will not, either individually or in aggregate, have a material adverse effect on our 
business, consolidated financial position, results of operations, or cash flows. However, the outcome of such 
matters is inherently unpredictable and subject to significant uncertainties.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
25We expense legal fees in the period in which they are incurred.
NonIncome Taxes
We are under audit by various domestic and foreign tax authorities with regards to nonincome tax matters. 
The subject matter of nonincome tax audits primarily arises from disputes on the tax treatment and tax rate applied 
to the sale of our products and services in these jurisdictions and the tax treatment of certain employee benefits. We 
accrue nonincome taxes that may result from examinations by, or any negotiated agreements with, these tax 
authorities when a loss is probable and reasonably estimable. If we determine that a loss is reasonably possible and 
the loss or range of loss can be estimated, we disclose the reasonably possible loss. Due to the inherent complexity 
and uncertainty of these matters and judicial process in certain jurisdictions, the final outcome may be materially 
different from our expectations.
For information regarding income tax contingencies, see Note 13 .
Note 10.    Stockholders' Equity  
Share Repurchases
In April 2021, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to $50.0 billion  of its 
Class C stock. In July 2021, th e Board of Directors of Alphabet approved an amendment to the April 2021 
authorization, permitting  the company to repurchase both Class A and Class C shares in a manner deemed in the 
best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market 
conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 
2022 , $4.1 billion  remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.  
In accordance with the authorization s of the Board of Directors of Alphabet, during the three months ended 
March 31, 2022 , we repurchased and subsequently retired 4.9 million  aggregate shares for $13.3 billion . Of the 
aggregate amount repurchased and subsequently retired during the  three months ended March 31, 2022 , 0.2 
million  shares were Class A stock for $660 million  and 4.7 million  shares were Class C stock for $12.6 billion .
In April 2022, the Board of Directors of Alphabet authorized the company to repurchase up to an additional 
$70.0 billion  of its Class A and Class C shares  in a manner deemed in the best interest of the company and its 
stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market conditions, including the relative trading 
prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares . 
Repurchases are  executed from time to time, subject to general business and market conditions and other 
investment opportunities, through open market purchases or privately negotiated transactions, including through 
Rule 10b51 plans. The repurchase program does not have an expiration date.
Stock Split Effected  in Form of Stock Dividend (“Stock Split”)
On February 1, 2022, the company announced that the Board of Directors had approved and declared a 20
forone stock split in the form of a onetime special stock dividend on each share of the company’s Class A, Class 
B, and Class C stock. The Stock Split is subject to stockholder approval of an amendment to the company’s 
Amended and Restated Certificate of Incorporation to increase the number of authorized shares of Class A, Class 
B, and Class C stock to accommodate the Stock Split .
If approval is obtained, each of the company’s stockholders of record at the close of business on July 1, 2022 
(the “Record Date”), will receive, after the close of business on July 15, 2022, a dividend of 19 additional shares of 
the same class of stock for every share held by such stockholder as of the Record Date.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

Note 14.    Information about Segments and Geographic Areas  
We report our segment results as Google Services, Google Cloud, and Other Bets:
Google Services includes products and services such as ads, Android, Chrome, hardware, Google Maps, 
Google Play, Search, and YouTube. Google Services generates revenues primarily from advertising; sales 
of apps and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and fees received for subscription
based products such as YouTube Premium and YouTube TV.
Google Cloud includes Google’s infrastructure and platform services, collaboration tools, and other services 
for enterprise customers. Google Cloud generates revenues from fees received for Google Cloud Platform 
services, Google Workspace collaboration tools, and other enterprise services.
Other Bets is a combination of multiple operating segments that are not individually material. Revenues 
from Other Bets are generated primarily from the sale of health technology and internet services.  
Revenues, certain costs, such as costs associated with content and traffic acquisition, certain engineering 
activities, and hardware, as well as certain operating expenses are directly attributable to our segments. Due to the 
integrated nature of Alphabet, other costs and expenses, such as technical infrastructure and office facilities, are 
managed centrally at a consolidated level. The associated costs, including depreciation and impairment, are 
allocated to operating segments as a service cost generally based on usage or headcount.
Unallocated corporate costs primarily include corporate initiatives, corporate shared costs, such as finance and 
legal, including certain fines and settlements, as well as costs associated with certain shared R&D activities. 
Additionally, hedging gains (losses) related to revenue are included in corporate costs.  
Our operating segments are not evaluated using asset information.

29ITEM 2. MANAGEMENT ’S DISCUSSION AND ANALYSIS OF FINANCIAL CONDITION AND RESULTS 
OF OPERATIONS
Please read the following discussion and analysis of our financial condition and results of operations together 
with "Note About ForwardLooking Statements" and our consolidated financial statements and related notes 
included under Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q as well as our Annual Report on Form 10K for the 
fiscal year ended December 31, 2021, including Part I, Item 1A "Risk Factors."
Understanding Alphabet’s Financial Results
Alphabet is a collection of businesses  the largest of which is Google. We report Google in two segments, 
Google Services and Google Cloud; we also report all nonGoogle businesses collectively as Other Bets. Other 
Bets include earlier stage technologies that are further afield from our core Google business. For further details on 
our segments, see Note 14  of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Item 1 of this Quarterly 
Report on Form 10Q.
Seasonality and other
Our advertising revenues are affected by seasonal fluctuations in internet usage, advertising expenditures, and 
underlying business trends, such as traditional retail seasonality. Additionally, our nonadvertising revenues , 
including those generated from Google Cloud, Google Play,  hardware, and YouTube, may be affected by 
fluctuations driven by changes in pricing, digital content releases, fee structures, new product and service launches, 
and other market dynamics, as well as seasonality. 
Revenues and Monetization Metrics  
Google Services
Google Services revenues consist of revenues generated from advertising (“Google advertising”) as well as 
revenues from other sources (“Google other revenues”).
Google Advertising
Google advertising revenues are comprised of the following: 
Google Search & other, which includes revenues generated on Google search properties (including 
revenues from traffic generated by search distribution partners who use Google.com as their default search 
in browsers, toolbars, etc.), and other Google owned and operated properties like Gmail, Google Maps, and 
Google Play;
YouTube ads, which includes revenues generated on YouTube properties; and
Google Network, which includes revenues generated on Google Network properties participating in AdMob, 
AdSense, and Google Ad Manager.
We use certain metrics to track how well traffic across various properties is monetized as it relates to our 
advertising revenues: paid clicks and costperclick pertain to traffic on Google Search & other properties, while 
impressions and costperimpressions pertain to traffic on our Network partners’ properties.
Paid clicks represent engagement by users and include clicks on advertisements by endusers on Google 
search properties and other Google owned and operated properties including Gmail, Google Maps, and Google 
Play. Costperclick is defined as clickdriven revenues divided by our total number of paid clicks and represents the 
average amount we charge advertisers for each engagement by users.
Impressions include impressions displayed to users on Google Network properties participating primarily in 
AdMob, AdSense, and Google Ad Manager. Costperimpression is defined as impressionbased and clickbased 
revenues divided by our total number of impressions, and represents the average amount we charge advertisers for 
each impression displayed to users.
As our business evolves, we periodically review, refine, and update our methodologies for monitoring, 
gathering, and counting the number of paid clicks and the number of impressions, and for identifying the revenues 
generated by the corresponding click and impression activity.
Our advertising revenue growth, as well as the change in paid clicks and costperclick on Google Search & 
other properties and the change in impressions and costperimpression on Google Network properties and the 
correlation between these items, have been affected and may continue to be affected by various factors, including:
advertiser competition for keywords;Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.

changes in device mix;
changes in foreign currency exchange rates;
fees advertisers are willing to pay based on how they manage their advertising costs;
general econo mic conditions  and various external dynamics, including t he effect of COVID19, geopolitical 
events, regulations and other measures;
seasonality; and
traffic growth in emerging markets compared to more mature markets and across various advertising 
verticals and channels.
Google Other

Google Play, which includes sales of apps and inapp purchases and digital content sold in the Google Play 
store;
Devices and Services, which includes sales of hardware, including Fitbit wearable devices, Google Nest 
home products, and Pixel phones;
YouTube nonadvertising, which includes YouTube Premium and YouTube TV subscriptions; and
other products and services.

Google Cloud Platform, which includes fees for infrastructure, platform, and other services;
Google Workspace, which includes fees for cloudbased collaboration tools for enterprises, such as Gmail, 
Docs, Drive, Calendar and Meet; and 
other enterprise services.
Other Bets

For further details on how we recognize revenue, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial 
Statements included in Part II, Item 8 in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 
2021 .
Costs and Expenses
Our cost structure has two components: cost of revenues and operating expenses. Our operating expenses 
include costs related to R&D, sales and marketing, and general and administrative functions. Certain of these 
expenses, including those associated with the operation of our technical infrastructure as well as components of our 
operating expenses, are generally less variable in nature and may not correlate to the changes in revenue.
Cost of Revenues
Cost of revenues is comprised of TAC and other costs of revenues.
TAC includes: 
◦Amounts paid to our distribution partners who make available our search access points and 
services. Our distribution partners include browser providers, mobile carriers, original equipment 
manufacturers, and software developers.
◦Amounts paid to Google Network partners primarily for ads displayed on their properties.
Other cost of revenues includes:
◦Content acquisition costs, which are payments to content providers from whom we license video 
and other content for distribution on YouTube and Google Play (we pay fees to these content 
providers based on revenues generated or a flat fee).Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
31◦Expenses associated with our data centers (including bandwidth, compensation expenses, 
depreciation, energy, and other equipment costs) as well as other operations costs (such as content 
review as well as customer and product support costs).
◦Inventory and other costs related to the hardware we sell.
The cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on Google Network properties 
are significantly higher than the cost of revenues as a percentage of revenues generated from ads placed on 
Google Search & other properties, because most of the advertiser revenues from ads served on Google Network 
properties are paid as TAC to our Google Network partners.
Operating Expenses
Operating expenses are generally incurred during our normal course of business, which we categorize as 
either R&D, sales and marketing, or general and administrative.
The main components of our R&D expenses are:
compensation expenses for engineering and technical employees responsible for R&D related to our 
existing and new products and services; 
depreciation; and
professional services fees primarily related to consulting and outsourcing services.
The main components of our sales and marketing expenses are:
compensation expenses for employees engaged in sales and marketing, sales support, and certain 
customer service functions; and
spending relating to our advertising and promotional activities in support of our products and services.
The main components of our general and administrative expenses are:
compensation expenses for employees in finance, human resources, information technology, legal, and 
other administrative support functions; 
expenses related to legal matters, including fines and settlements; and 
professional services fees, including audit, consulting, outside legal, and outsourcing services.
Other Income (Expense), Net 
Other income (expense), net primarily consists of interest income (expense), the effect of foreign currency 
exchange gains (losses), net gains (losses) and impairment on our marketable and nonmarketable securities, 
performance fees, and income (loss) and impairment from our equity method investments. 
For additional details, including how we account for our investments and factors that can drive fluctuations in 
the value of our investments, see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 
8 and Item 7A, “Quantitative and Qualitative Disclosur es About Market Risk” in our An nual Report on Form 10K for 
the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021  as well as Note 3 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements 
included in Item 1 of this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q.
Provision for Income Taxes  
Provision for income taxes represents the estimated amount of federal, state, and foreign income taxes 
incurred in the U.S. and the many jurisdictions in which we operate. The provision includes the effect of reserve 
provisions and changes to reserves that are considered appropriate as well as the related net interest and penalties.
For additional details , see Note 1 of the Notes to Consolidated Financial Statements included in Part II, Item 8 
in our An nual Report on Form 10K for the fiscal year ended December 31, 2021  as well as Note 13  of the Notes to

Use of Constant Currency Revenues and Constant Currency Revenue Percentage Change
The effect of currency exchange rates on our business is an important factor in understanding period to period 
comparisons. We use nonGAAP constant currency revenues and nonGAAP percentage change in constant 
currency revenues for financial and operational decisionmaking and as a means to evaluate periodtoperiod 
comparisons. We believe the presentation of results on a constant currency basis in addition to GAAP results helps 
improve the ability to understand our performance because it excludes the effects of foreign currency volatility that 
are not indicative of our core operating results.
Constant currency information compares results between periods as if exchange rates had remained constant 
period over period. We define constant currency revenues as total revenues excluding the effect of foreign 
exchange rate movements and hedging activities, and use it to determine the constant currency revenue 
percentage change on a yearonyear basis. Constant currency revenues are calculated by translating current 
period revenues using prior year comparable period exchange rates, as well as excluding any hedging effects 
realized in the current period.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
35Constant currency revenue percentage change is calculated by determining the change in current period 
revenues over prior year comparable period revenues where current period foreign currency revenues are 
translated using prior year comparable period exchange rates and hedging effects are excluded from revenues of 
both periods.
These results should be considered in addition to, not as a substitute for, results reported in accordance with 
GAAP. Results on a constant currency basis, as we present them, may not be comparable to similarly titled 
measures used by other companies and are not a measure of performance presented in accordance with GAAP.

36Cost of revenues increased  $5.5 billion  from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2022 . The increase  was due to increases in other cost of revenues and TAC of $3.2 billion  and 
$2.3 billion , respectively.
The increase in TAC from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three months ended March 31, 2022  
was due to increases in TAC paid to distribution partners and to Google Network partners, primarily driven by 
growth in revenues subject to TAC. The TAC rate  increased  from 21.7%  to 21.9%  from the three months ended 
March 31, 2021  to the three months ended March 31, 2022  due to a combination of factors none of which were 
individually significant . The TAC rate on Google Search & other properties revenues  and the TAC rate on Google 
Network revenues were both substantially consistent  from three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2022 .
The increase i n other cost of revenues from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2022  was primarily  due to increases in data center  and other operations costs, including 
depreciation expense,  as well as content acquisition costs primarily for YouTube.

performance fees.  In the three months ended March 31, 2022, $1.5 billion  of net unrealized losses were recognized 
on marketable equity securities, partially offset by $460 million  of net unrealized gains on nonmarketable equity 
securities and a $233 million  reversal of previously accrued performance fees related to certain investments. In the 
three months ended March 31, 2021, a net unrealized gain of $4.7 billion  was recognized on nonmarketable equity 
securities, partially offset by $665 million  of accrued performance fees.

The effective tax rate decreased  2.6%  from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three months 
ended March 31, 2022 . The decrease was primarily due to a benefit  driven by the effects of capitalization and 
amortization of research and development expenses starting in 2022 as required by the 2017 Tax Cuts and Jobs Act 
generating an increase in the U.S. federal ForeignDerived Intangible Income tax deduction . 
Financial Condition
Cash, Cash Equivalents, and Marketable Securities
As of March 31, 2022 , we had $134.0 billion  in cash, cash equivalents, and shortterm marketable securities. 
Cash equivalents and marketable securities a re comprised of time deposits, money market funds, highly liquid 
government bonds, corporate debt securities, mortgagebacked and assetbacked securities and marketable equity 
securities.
Sources, Uses of Cash and Related Trends
Our principal sources of liquidity are our cash, cash equivalents, and marketable securities, as well as the cash 
flow that we generate from operations. The primary use of capital continues to be to invest for the longterm growth 
of the business. We regularly evaluate our cash and capital structure, including the size, pace and form of capital 
return to stockholders.
The following table presents our cash flows (in millions):
 Three Months Ended
March 31,
 2021 2022
Net cash provided by operating activities $ 19,289 $ 25,106 
Net cash used in investing activities $ (5,383) $ (9,051) 
Net cash used in financing activities $ (13,606) $ (16,214) 
Cash Provided by Operating Activities
Our largest source of cash provided by operations are advertising revenues generated by Google Search & 
other properties, Google Network properties and YouTube ads. Additionally, we generate cash through sales of apps 
and inapp purchases, digital content products, and hardware; and licensing and service fees including fees 
received for Google Cloud offerings and subscriptionbased products.
Our primary uses of cash from our operating activities include payments to distribution and Google Network 
partners, for compensation and related costs, and for content acquisition costs. In addition, uses of cash from 
operating activities include hardware inventory costs, income taxes, and other general corporate expenditures.
Net cash provided by operating activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2022  primarily due to the net effect of an increase in cash received from revenues and 
cash paid for cost of revenues and operating expense s, and changes in operating assets and liabilities .
Cash Used in Investing Activities
Cash provided by investing activities consists primarily of maturities and sales of investments in marketable 
and nonmarketable securities. Cash used in investing activities consists primarily of purchases of marketable and 
nonmarketable securities, purchases of property and equipment, and payments for acquisitions.
Net cash used in investing activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2022  primarily due to  an increase of purchases of property and equipment, partially offset Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
39by a net decrease in maturities and sales of securities. The increase in property and equipment was primarily due to 
the purchases of office facilities.
Cash Used in Financing Activities
Cash provided by financing activities consists primarily of proceeds from issuance of debt and proceeds from 
the sale of interest in consolidated entities. Cash used in financing activities consists primarily of repurchases of 
stock, net payments related to stockbased award activities, and repayments of debt.
Net cash used in financing activities increased  from the three months ended March 31, 2021  to the three 
months ended March 31, 2022  primarily due to an increase in repurchases of stock. 
Liquidity and Material Cash Requirements
We expect existing cash, cash equivalents, shortterm marketable securities, cash flows from operations and 
financing activities to continue to be sufficient to fund our operating activities and cash commitments for investing 
and financing activities for at least the next 12 months and thereafter for the foreseeable future .
Capital Expenditures and Leases
We make investments in land and buildings for data centers and offices and information technology assets 
through purchases of property and equipment and lease arrangements to provide capacity for the growth of our 
services and products. 
Capital Expenditures
Our capital investments in property and equipment consist primarily of the following major categories:
technical infrastructure, which consists of investments in servers and network equipment for computing, 
storage and networking requirements for ongoing business activities, including machine learning 
(collectively referred to as information technology assets) and data center land and building construction; 
and
office facilities,  ground up development projects , and related building improvements.
Construction in progress consists primarily of technical infrastructure and office facilities which have not yet 
been placed in service for our intended use. The time frame from date of purchase to placement in service of these 
assets may extend from months to years. For example, our data center construction projects are generally multi
year projects with multiple phases, where we acquire qualified land and buildings, construct buildings, and secure 
and install information technology assets.

Share Repurchase Program

best interest of the company and its stockholders, taking into account the economic cost and prevailing market 
conditions, including the relative trading prices and volumes of the Class A and Class C shares. As of March 31, 
2022 , $4.1 billion  remains available for Class A and Class C share repurchases under the amended authorization.

June 30, 2018 ), and €1.5 billion  ($1.7 billion  as of March 20, 2019 ), respectively. While each EC decision is under

ITEM 3. QUANTITATIVE AND QUALITATIVE DISCLOSURES ABOUT MARKET RISK
For quantitative and qualitative disclosures about market risk, refer to Part II, Item 7A, Quantitative and 
Qualitative Disclosures About Market Risk, in our Annual Report on Form 10K for the year ended December 31, 
2021 .
ITEM 4. CONTROLS AND PROCEDURES
Evaluation of Disclosure Controls and Procedures
Our management, with the participation of our chief executive officer and chief financial officer, evaluated the 
effectiveness of our disclosure controls and procedures pursuant to Rule 13a15 under the Exchange Act, as of the 
end of the period covered by this Quarterly Report on Form 10Q.
Based on this evaluation, our chief executive officer and chief financial officer concluded that, as of March 31, 
2022 , our disclosure controls and procedures are designed at a reasonable assurance level and are effective to 
provide reasonable assurance that information we are required to disclose in reports that we file or submit under the 
Exchange Act is recorded, processed, summarized, and reported within the time periods specified in the SEC’s 
rules and forms, and that such information is accumulated and communicated to our management, including our 
chief executive officer and chief financial officer, as appropriate, to allow timely decisions regarding required 
disclosure.
Changes in Internal Control over Financial Reporting
We rely extensively on information systems to manage our business and summarize and report operating 
results. In 2019, we began a multiyear implementation of a new global enterprise resource planning (ERP) system, 
which will replace much of our existing core financial systems. The ERP system is designed to accurately maintain 
our financial records, enhance the flow of financial information, improve data management and provide timely 
information to our management team. The implementation is expected to continue in phases over the next few 
years. There have been no changes in our internal control over financial reporting that occurred during the quarter 
ended March 31, 2022  that have materially affected, or are reasonably likely to materially affect, our internal control 
over financial reporting. However, as the phased implementation of the new ERP system continues, we will change 
our processes and procedures, which in turn, could result in changes to our internal control over financial reporting. 
As such changes occur, we will evaluate quarterly whether such changes materially affect our internal control over 
financial reporting.
As a result of COVID19, our global workforce continued to operate primarily in a work from home environment 
for the quarter ended March 31, 2022 . While we continue to evolve our work model in response to the uneven 
effects of the ongoing pandemic around the world, we believe that our internal controls over financial reporting 
continue to be effective. We have continued to reevaluate and refine our financial reporting process to provide 
reasonable assurance that we could report our financial results accurately and timely.
Limitations on Effectiveness of Controls and Procedures
In designing and evaluating the disclosure controls and procedures, management recognizes that any controls 
and procedures, no matter how well designed and operated, can provide only reasonable assurance of achieving 
the desired control objectives. In addition, the design of disclosure controls and procedures must reflect the fact that 
there are resource constraints and that management is required to apply its judgment in evaluating the benefits of 
possible controls and procedures relative to their costs.Table of Contents Alphabet Inc.
